# Data Science Tasks at Prodigy Infotech

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice. In this task, interns are required to analyze the dataset, identify missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, and perform necessary data cleaning techniques. Exploratory data analysis will involve visualizing the data to understand its distributions, relationships between variables, and identifying patterns and trends.

### Dataset:
- Interns can choose any dataset for EDA, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, Iris dataset, or any other dataset relevant to their interests.

### Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- Visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) to illustrate patterns and trends in the data.

## Task 2: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. In this task, interns will perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data to analyze sentiment trends over time or in response to specific events.

### Dataset:
- Twitter sentiment analysis dataset containing tweets related to the chosen topic or brand.

### Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing sentiment analysis and visualization.
- Sentiment analysis results, including sentiment distribution, sentiment over time, and sentiment towards specific topics or brands.
- Visualizations (e.g., word clouds, sentiment histograms, sentiment over time plots) to illustrate sentiment patterns.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK (for sentiment analysis)
